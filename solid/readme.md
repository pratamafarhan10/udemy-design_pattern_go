# SOLID

## Single Responsibility
The purpose that is your class, your type, your construct, or your package has a single primary responsibility. For example a journal struct has several methods to modify the journal. When we want to have another function to store it into a file, we have to create new struct. We adopt the idea of separation of concerns

## Open-Closed
States that type is open for extension but closed for modification.
